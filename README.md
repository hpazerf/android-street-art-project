Create an android app with a database connection to a web-app
Created this project in a group with 4 people including myself

Project overview:
-crowd sourced application
-login functionality
-ability to post information including images, location, and text
-designating a theme for each post
-ability to add a personal "tag" to each post similar to a hastag
-ability to search based on user, theme, and "tag"

Project details:
-Created an app that is designed to take pictures of street art post it to app
-Similar to other image posting applications but with a focus on different types of street art
-Used location as a functionality for other users to be able to find the street art
-Themes were based on the different styles of street art
-Created an integrated database that allows the user to hav access to the posts in both the android and web-app
-Created a login page that allows the user to create an account and create or alter their own posts

Future updates can involve allowing a tag to become a theme if it is posted enough based on the users and supervision of the themes
